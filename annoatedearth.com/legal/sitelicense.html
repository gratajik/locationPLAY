			<DIV>Collection of Information: Cookies; Personal<BR>
				For each visitor to an AnnotatedEarth Web site, AnnotatedEarth's Web server

				log on, unless you've activated blocking technology available in some browsers.
			</DIV>
			<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
			<DIV>When you visit AnnotatedEarth's sites or advertisements appearing thereon, or 
				use one or more of the AnnotatedEarth Web site services, we may use an 
				industry-wide technology called "cookies" which stores certain information on 
				your computer and which will allow us to customize your experience to better 
				match your interests and preferences or to simply facilitate your signing in to 
				use the services. Most browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your 
				computer hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a 
				cookie is stored. However, if you block or erase cookies, we may not be able to 
				restore any preferences or customization settings you previously specified and 
				our ability to personalize your online experience would be limited. Please 
				refer to your browser instructions or "help" screen to learn more about these 
				functions.
			</DIV>
			<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
			<DIV>Additionally, AnnotatedEarth may ask you to provide "personal information", 
				meaning individually identifiable information that you provide on our Web sites 
				such as your email address, name, mailing address, telephone number, social 
				security number, credit card number, or persistent identifier (such as a 
				customer number held in a cookie) which is associated with individually 
				identifiable information, to enable you to participate in contests, chat rooms, 
				on bulletin boards, to fill out a registration, or to order products and 
				services using these sites. AnnotatedEarth may combine the information you 
				provide on our Web sites with other information we may collect from you or from 
				third parties so that we can more effectively tailor our site, services and 
				offerings to you. If you provide AnnotatedEarth with personal information, you 
				shall have the right, on reasonable prior notice, to inspect, change, amend or 
				delete such information. Instructions on how to update personal information 
				will be given at the point of data collection.
			</DIV>
			<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
			<DIV>Unless you instruct us otherwise, AnnotatedEarth may contact you to provide 
				information about products, services, promotions, contests, or other activities 
				or offerings that may be of interest to you. You can instruct us whether or not 
				you wish to be contacted by checking or removing the check from the box 
				indicating your preference as applicable at the place where your information is 
				collected, or by other means (such as an email request). In addition, with each 
				communication you receive from AnnotatedEarth, you will be given the 
				opportunity to indicate if you do not wish to receive future communications.
			</DIV>
			<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
			<DIV>Unless it is for the purposes you have requested or originally agreed, 
				AnnotatedEarth will not share the personal information you provide on the 
				AnnotatedEarth Web sites with any other parties, except (a) with your consent;

			<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
			<DIV>Additionally and with your consent, AnnotatedEarth may share your personal 
				information with other affiliated AnnotatedEarth.com companies (i.e., (i) 
				AnnotatedEarth.com Corporation, (ii) any company of which more than 50% of its 
				outstanding shares are owned by AnnotatedEarth.com, directly or indirectly, or 
				(iii) any company with the name "AnnotatedEarth" as a part of its trade name) 
				who may want to contact you about products, services or other offerings that

				If you consent to receiving communications from any of these affiliated 
				AnnotatedEarth.com companies, or third parties, you will need to communicate

				AnnotatedEarth.com affiliates and/or specific third parties outside of the 
				AnnotatedEarth.com group of companies, changes or amendments to your personal 
				information must be given both to AnnotatedEarth and to each such 
				AnnotatedEarth.com affiliate or other company directly as these changes, 
				amendments and/or deletions will not be exchanged among AnnotatedEarth and 
				other AnnotatedEarth.com affiliates or third parties.
			</DIV>
			<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
			<DIV>Security<BR>
				While AnnotatedEarth cannot guarantee that unauthorized access will never 
				occur, rest assured that AnnotatedEarth takes great care in maintaining the 
				security of your personal information and in preventing unauthorized access to 
				it through the use of appropriate technology and internal procedures.
			</DIV>
			<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
			<DIV>Notice To/Regarding Children Under the Age of 13<BR>
				AnnotatedEarth believes that children using the Internet require special 
				protection, and we urge parents or guardians to explain Internet safety to 
				their children. Parents are urged to spend time online with their children to 
				become familiar with the types of content available on the AnnotatedEarth sites 
				and the Internet in general. Control tools are available from online services 
				and software manufacturers to help create a safer environment for children.
			</DIV>
			<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
			<DIV>If a child under 13 years of age wishes to participate in any AnnotatedEarth 
				Web site activity, or wishes to take advantage of a product or service 
				offering, available to children, and to do so necessitates the furnishing of 
				any of the child's personal information, please note the following:
			</DIV>
			<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
			<DIV>(i) Before any collection of a child's personal information takes place at a 
				web site directed to children or where AnnotatedEarth is knowingly collecting 
				children's personal information, the child will be asked to provide his/her 
				parent's or guardian's e-mail address. AnnotatedEarth will then send an e-mail 
				(the "Initial Notification") to the parent/guardian indicating, among other 
				things, the information that the child is requested to provide, the intended 
				use(s) of the information and information on how the parent/guardian can, at 
				their election, delete the child's information from AnnotatedEarth's database 
				or records. Upon receipt of the Initial Notification, a parent or guardian may 
				respond back to AnnotatedEarth to grant his/her consent or to deny consent, in 
				which case AnnotatedEarth will delete the parent or guardian's e-mail address. 
				Upon AnnotatedEarth's receipt of the parent/guardian consent, AnnotatedEarth 
				will send a confirming e-mail to the parent/guardian's e-mail address,
			</DIV>
			<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
			<DIV>(ii)The e-mail address of the operator collecting or maintaining personal 
				information from children through this Web site are: <A href="mailto:parents@AnnotatedEarth.com">
					parents@AnnotatedEarth.com</A>,
			</DIV>
			<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
			<DIV>(iii) The types of personal information collected from children may include 
				the name, e-mail address, home address, telephone number and/or any other 
				information reasonably necessary for the child to participate in a particular 
				activity. This information may be collected directly and/or passively (e.g., 
				through a web server that automatically recognized and stores information such 
				as a visitor's IP address/domain name combination),
			</DIV>
			<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
			<DIV>(iv) The information collected may be used for purposes such as fulfillment of 
				a requested transaction, record keeping, marketing back to the child, or making 
				it publicly available through a chat room or by other means,
			</DIV>
			<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
			<DIV>(v) Unless specific consent is obtained from the child's parent or guardian, 
				the child's personal information will not be disclosed to third parties who are 
				not contractors hired to carry out the internal operations of the Web sites, 
				other than as may be required or permitted by law. We have required, or will 
				require, such contractors to agree to use personal information of site visitors 
				only for the purposes of carrying out these operations and to keep such 
				information confidential. A parent or guardian has the option of consenting to 
				the collection and use of the child's personal information without consenting 
				to the disclosure of that information to third parties,
			</DIV>
			<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
			<DIV>(vi) AnnotatedEarth is prohibited from conditioning a child's participation in 
				an activity on the child's disclosing more personal information than is 
				reasonably necessary to participate in such activity,
			</DIV>
			<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
			<DIV>(vii) A parent can review and have deleted the child's personal information, 
				can refuse to permit further collection or use of the child's information, and 
				can revoke or limit consents previously given. For instructions on how to do 
				so, please send an e-mail to: <A href="mailto:PIM@AnnotatedEarth.com">PIM@AnnotatedEarth.com</A>
				and
			</DIV>
			<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
			<DIV>(viii) If AnnotatedEarth desires to use a child's information for purposes 
				other than that for which the parent/guardian consent was previously given, 
				AnnotatedEarth will not do so without first getting the parent/guardian 
				consent.
			</DIV>
			<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
			<DIV>Use and Disclosure of Anonymous Aggregated Information<BR>
				AnnotatedEarth may also collect, aggregate and maintain anonymous information 
				about the visitors to our Web sites, such as visitors' hobbies, interests, 
				purchasing habits, music preferences, and the like. This data can then be used 
				to tailor AnnotatedEarth's Web site content and advertising to deliver a better 
				experience for our visitors. In addition, AnnotatedEarth may also share such 
				aggregate information about our visitors with advertisers, business partners, 
				sponsors, and other third parties; for example, to inform them about the 
				percentage of male/female visitors or percentage of visitors within a 
				particular age range.
			</DIV>
			<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
			<DIV>Consent to Processing:<BR>
				By providing any personal information to the AnnotatedEarth Sites, all users, 
				including without limitation users in the member states of the European Union, 
				fully understand and unambiguously consent to the collection and processing of 
				such information in the United States of America.</DIV>
			<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
			<DIV>Policy Governs Use; Changes to Privacy Policy<BR>
				The terms of this policy will govern the use and any information collected 
				while it is in place. AnnotatedEarth reserves the right to change this policy 
				at any time, so please re-visit this page as often as you wish. Changes to this 
				privacy policy are effective at the time they are posted to this site.
			</DIV>
			<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
			<DIV>Questions:<BR>
				If you have any questions or comments about our personal information practices 
				or about this privacy statement, please feel free to send us an email at <A href="mailto:policy@AnnotatedEarth.com">
