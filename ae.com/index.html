				<P>Welcome to the Annotated Earth. AnnotatedEarth allows computers to figure out 
					what's around them, to know "location-aware" information. By access spatial 
					information, using a device like a GPS, users can know what's around them, 
					what's close by that might be of interest to them. "Location-aware" is 
					sometimes called "context-aware", which means that computers can better help 
					users by not only understanding a request from them, but the also the location 
					context that the question was asked in.
